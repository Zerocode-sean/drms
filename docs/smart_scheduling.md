# Smart Scheduling in DRMS

## Overview

Smart Scheduling is a core component of the Driver Request Management System (DRMS) that automates and optimizes the assignment of waste collection requests to drivers. Its goals are to maximize efficiency, minimize operational costs, and improve service quality by leveraging clustering, time slotting, and route optimization algorithms.

## Technical Details

### 1. Clustering
- **Purpose:** Group waste collection requests that are geographically close (e.g., within a 2km radius).
- **How:**
  - Use a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, K-means, or simple radius-based grouping) on the latitude/longitude of requests.
  - Each cluster represents a set of requests that can be serviced together, reducing travel time and fuel consumption.

### 2. Time Slot Assignment
- **Purpose:** Allocate requests to optimal time slots (e.g., Morning: 8-12, Afternoon: 12-4, Evening: 4-8).
- **How:**
  - Consider user preferences, driver availability, and cluster size.
  - Balance workload across available slots.

### 3. Driver Assignment
- **Purpose:** Assign clusters or requests to drivers based on availability and capacity.
- **How:**
  - Check each driver's current load and capacity.
  - Assign clusters to drivers who can handle the volume and are available in the required time slot.

### 4. Route Optimization
- **Purpose:** Minimize total travel distance and time for each driver.
- **How:**
  - Use a route optimization algorithm (e.g., Nearest Neighbor, TSP approximation) to determine the most efficient order of stops within each cluster.
  - Output an optimized route for each driver.

### 5. Fuel Savings Estimation
- **Purpose:** Quantify efficiency improvements from smart scheduling.
- **How:**
  - Compare the total distance of optimized routes to a naive (unoptimized) approach.
  - Estimate fuel savings and environmental impact.

## Example Flow

1. **Admin initiates scheduling** for a target date.
2. **System fetches all pending requests** for that date.
3. **Requests are clustered** by geographic proximity (e.g., 2km radius).
4. **Time slots are assigned** to each cluster based on preferences and availability.
5. **Drivers are assigned** to clusters, considering capacity and workload.
6. **Routes are optimized** for each driver within their assigned cluster.
7. **Schedule is displayed** to the admin for review and possible manual adjustments.
8. **Finalized schedule** is saved and notifications are sent to drivers and residents.

## Testing Smart Scheduling

### Prerequisites
- Seed the database with multiple requests in different locations and times.
- Ensure drivers are available with defined capacities.

### Steps
1. **Trigger smart scheduling** (via admin dashboard or API endpoint).
2. **Review the output:**
   - Are requests grouped into logical clusters?
   - Are time slots and drivers assigned efficiently?
   - Are routes optimized (shortest/fastest path)?
   - Are estimated fuel savings reported?
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Test with requests that are far apart (should form separate clusters).
   - Test with more requests than driver capacity (should balance load).
   - Test with overlapping time preferences.

## Potential Improvements
- Use more advanced clustering (e.g., dynamic radius, machine learning-based grouping).
- Integrate real-time traffic data for route optimization.
- Allow residents to select preferred time slots with more granularity.
- Provide live tracking and dynamic re-routing for drivers.
- Add analytics for historical efficiency and environmental impact.
