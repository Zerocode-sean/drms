# DRMS Logical Model - Executive Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **DRMS (Driver Request Management System)** is a comprehensive waste collection management platform designed to streamline the entire process from waste collection requests to driver assignments and route optimization.

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with responsive design
- **Backend**: PHP with RESTful API architecture
- **Database**: MySQL with optimized schema and indexing
- **External Services**: Mapping APIs, SMS/Email gateways

### User Roles & Access
