Read request.php, lines 193 to 210

The map CSS looks good. Let's test the page now to see if our fixes work:

Opened Simple Browser at http://localhost/project/src/frontend/assets/request.php

ðŸ”§ Step 6: Add Error Handling and Debugging
Let's add some console logging to help debug any remaining issues:

request.php+34-0
Now let's update the page initialization to include the debug button:

Read request.php, lines 1110 to 1130

Let me find the DOMContentLoaded event listener:

Read request.php, lines 1061 to 1090

request.php+3-0
ðŸ”§ Step 7: Test and Verify the Fixes
Let's create a simple test to see if our fixes are working. First, let's reload the page:

Opened Simple Browser at http://localhost/project/src/frontend/assets/request.php

Let's also create a simple test file to verify our API endpoint works:

Created test_request_api.php

Now let's test this API test file:

Opened Simple Browser at http://localhost/project/test_request_api.php

ðŸ“‹ Summary of Fixes Applied
Here's what we've fixed step by step:

âœ… Step 1: Authentication
Temporarily bypassed authentication for development/testing
Added proper authentication structure for production
âœ… Step 2: API Path
Fixed form action from place_request.php to place_request.php
âœ… Step 3: Data Format
Changed from FormData to JSON format (what the API expects)
Added proper headers for JSON requests
âœ… Step 4: Field Names
Updated form field IDs to match API expectations:
contact_phone â†’ phone
contact_email â†’ email
âœ… Step 5: Data Mapping
Added proper data mapping for the API request
Added time conversion helper function
Included location data (latitude, longitude, resolved_address)
âœ… Step 6: Debugging
Added debug functions and buttons for troubleshooting
Added console logging for better error tracking
âœ… Step 7: Testing
Created API test file to verify the backend works
Set up test session for development
ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps for Full Production
Restore Authentication: Remove the bypass and ensure proper login system
Database Table Consistency: Fix the requests vs requests1 table issue
Error Handling: Add more robust error handling
Input Validation: Add server-side validation
Security: Add CSRF protection and input sanitization
The request page should now be much more functional! The main issues were:

Wrong API path
Wrong data format (FormData vs JSON)
Field name mismatches
Missing session setup for testing
You can test the form now by:

Opening http://localhost/project/src/frontend/assets/request.php
Filling out the form
Selecting a location on the map
Submitting the request
